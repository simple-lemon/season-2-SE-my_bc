step one:
  The reading size is entered through the variable "READLINE_READ_SIZE" in the 7th line of the my_readline.c file.
step two:
  file is compiled via Makefile.
step three:
  If the content is read from stdin, it is enough to write "./my_readline" to the terminal, and the name of other files should be entered from argv.
  for example: ./my_readline file.txt
