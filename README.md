# Welcome to My Bc

## Task
task was about to implement basic calculator, which can handle with basic operations and mode complicated one like %.

## Description
first I wanted to write it with my own algorithm but then I noticed that in Description there is shunting yard alogrith which is useful for mathematical expressions. We were asked to learn this algorithm  and apply it in our code. Honestly the algorithm  was way easier to undestand than I thought, after watching some videos, idea became clear and I started to write program.

## Installation
There is no need to install it, if you are interested you can download my code from my git account.
## Usage
you just type mathematical exercise and my program gives back its result
```
./my_bc "-12+12"
0
```
